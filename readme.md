# Simple Web Scraper with User Interface

## Idea

This is a mock-up of a simple web scraping interface, used for accessing data from the internet for data analysis. 

## Functionality

Although currently very basic it is possible to add features to enable a fairly data-rich environment.
There are three pages using three different options:
1. Enter a URL and it retrieves info via HTML scraping
2. Uses a .csv file to generate a preview, plus some data charts.
3. Uses an .xlsx file to generate a preview, plus some data charts.

## Possible upgrades

Streamlit is a very capable piece of front end code that you can use to generate a web page based on pythonic interaction web based data.

One could easily engender _auth_ protocols for all the major platforms using it too. 

## Tech 

- Python
- StreamLit
- Requests Lib

## Usage

This code is freely available for anyone to fork and use at their leisure.
